# Multi-Agent Architecture Design for SRE Copilot

## Overview

This document outlines the multi-agent architecture design for an SRE copilot system built on AWS Bedrock. The system leverages AWS Bedrock's foundation models and multi-agent collaboration capabilities to provide comprehensive root cause analysis for incidents using logs, metrics, and dashboards.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Hierarchical Collaboration Model**: A supervisor agent coordinates specialized agents
2. **Domain Specialization**: Each agent focuses on specific aspects of root cause analysis
3. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different data sources
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Agents share insights through a common knowledge base
5. **Multi-Modal Analysis**: System processes text, metrics, and visual data

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

### 1. Supervisor Agent

**Primary Model**: Amazon Nova Pro (supports text, image, video inputs)

**Responsibilities**:
- Receive and interpret incident alerts and user queries
- Coordinate the activities of specialized agents
- Prioritize analysis tasks based on incident severity
- Synthesize findings from specialized agents
- Present final root cause analysis and recommendations
- Manage user interactions and follow-up questions

### 2. Log Analysis Agent

**Primary Model**: Claude 3 Haiku (optimized for text processing)

**Responsibilities**:
- Process structured and unstructured log data
- Identify anomalous log patterns
- Detect error messages and exceptions
- Correlate log events across services
- Extract timestamps and sequence of events
- Provide log-based insights to the Supervisor Agent

### 3. Metrics Analysis Agent

**Primary Model**: Amazon Titan Text G1 - Express

**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze time-series metrics data
- Detect anomalies in performance metrics
- Identify metric correlations
- Compare current metrics against baselines
- Analyze resource utilization patterns
- Provide metrics-based insights to the Supervisor Agent

### 4. Dashboard Interpretation Agent

**Primary Model**: Amazon Nova Lite (supports text, image, video inputs)

**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze dashboard screenshots and visualizations
- Interpret graphs, charts, and visual alerts
- Extract key information from visual data
- Identify visual patterns and anomalies
- Correlate visual insights with other data sources
- Provide visualization-based insights to the Supervisor Agent

### 5. Knowledge Base Agent

**Primary Model**: Amazon Titan Embeddings G1

**Responsibilities**:
- Maintain historical incident data
- Store common failure patterns and solutions
- Retrieve relevant past incidents
- Identify similarities with previous issues
- Suggest potential solutions based on past experiences
- Provide knowledge-based insights to the Supervisor Agent

## Communication Flow

1. **Incident Initiation**:
   - User reports incident or automated alert triggers analysis
   - Supervisor Agent receives initial information
   - Supervisor Agent creates analysis plan

2. **Parallel Analysis**:
   - Supervisor Agent dispatches tasks to specialized agents
   - Log Analysis Agent processes log data
   - Metrics Analysis Agent analyzes metrics
   - Dashboard Interpretation Agent examines visualizations
   - Knowledge Base Agent retrieves relevant historical data

3. **Insight Aggregation**:
   - Specialized agents report findings to Supervisor Agent
   - Supervisor Agent correlates insights across data sources
   - Supervisor Agent identifies potential root causes

4. **Resolution Recommendation**:
   - Supervisor Agent synthesizes comprehensive analysis
   - Knowledge Base Agent suggests potential solutions
   - Supervisor Agent presents findings and recommendations to user
   - Knowledge Base Agent stores incident details for future reference

## Integration Points

### Data Source Integration

1. **Log Sources**:
   - CloudWatch Logs
   - Application logs
   - System logs
   - Custom log sources

2. **Metrics Sources**:
   - CloudWatch Metrics
   - Custom application metrics
   - System performance metrics
   - Business metrics

3. **Dashboard Sources**:
   - CloudWatch Dashboards
   - Grafana
   - Custom visualization tools
   - Third-party monitoring platforms

### AWS Service Integration

1. **AWS Bedrock**:
   - Foundation models for each agent
   - Multi-agent collaboration framework
   - Knowledge bases for historical data

2. **CloudWatch**:
   - Log ingestion and processing
   - Metrics collection and analysis
   - Alarm integration

3. **Other AWS Services**:
   - EventBridge for event processing
   - S3 for data storage
   - Lambda for serverless processing
   - IAM for access control

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimization

1. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Agents work simultaneously on different data sources
   - Prioritize critical analysis paths
   - Implement timeouts for non-responsive components

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Allocate appropriate model sizes based on task complexity
   - Scale resources based on incident severity
   - Implement resource pooling for efficiency

### Security and Compliance

1. **Data Protection**:
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data
   - Apply least privilege access principles
   - Ensure compliance with data retention policies

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Audit all system actions
   - Secure API endpoints

### Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Add specialized agents for new data sources
   - Distribute workload across multiple instances
   - Implement load balancing

2. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - Upgrade to more powerful models as needed
   - Increase resource allocation for complex incidents
   - Optimize processing algorithms

## Next Steps

1. Design detailed log, metrics, and dashboard integration
2. Implement root cause analysis system based on this architecture
3. Develop multi-modal capabilities for each agent
4. Test and validate the solution with real-world scenarios
5. Prepare comprehensive documentation and deployment guide
