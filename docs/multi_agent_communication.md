# Multi-Agent Communication Design for SRE Copilot

## Communication Patterns

This document details the communication patterns between agents in the SRE copilot multi-agent architecture.

### Agent Communication Protocol

#### Message Structure
All inter-agent communications will follow a standardized JSON format:

```json
{
  "message_id": "unique-id",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "sender": "agent-name",
  "recipient": "agent-name",
  "message_type": "request|response|notification",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "content": {
    "action": "analyze|report|query|recommend",
    "data": {},
    "context": {}
  }
}
```

#### Communication Channels
1. **Direct Communication**: Point-to-point messages between agents
2. **Broadcast Communication**: Messages sent to all agents
3. **Topic-based Communication**: Messages sent to agents subscribed to specific topics

### Orchestration Mechanisms

#### Task Allocation
The Supervisor Agent will allocate tasks based on:
- Agent specialization
- Current agent workload
- Task priority
- Dependencies between tasks

#### Synchronization Points
The following synchronization points ensure coordinated analysis:
1. **Initial Assessment**: All agents report initial findings
2. **Correlation Phase**: Agents share insights for cross-correlation
3. **Final Synthesis**: All agents provide final analysis for integration

#### Error Handling
1. **Agent Failure**: Supervisor detects non-responsive agents and redistributes tasks
2. **Inconsistent Results**: Supervisor resolves conflicting insights through weighted consensus
3. **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts prevent blocking on non-critical analyses

### Knowledge Sharing Framework

#### Shared Knowledge Repository
A central knowledge repository will store:
- Current incident context
- Agent findings and insights
- Historical incident data
- Common failure patterns
- Resolution strategies

#### Knowledge Update Protocol
1. **Write Operations**: Agents submit findings to the repository
2. **Read Operations**: Agents query the repository for context
3. **Update Notifications**: Agents receive notifications of relevant updates

#### Context Preservation
To maintain context across the analysis:
1. **Incident Timeline**: Chronological record of events
2. **Entity Relationships**: Mapping of services, components, and dependencies
3. **Analysis Provenance**: Tracking of how insights were derived

## Decision-Making Process

### Collaborative Analysis
1. **Evidence Collection**: Each agent collects and analyzes domain-specific data
2. **Insight Generation**: Agents generate hypotheses based on their analysis
3. **Cross-validation**: Agents validate hypotheses against other domains
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Hypotheses are scored based on supporting evidence

### Root Cause Determination
The Supervisor Agent determines root causes through:
1. **Weighted Voting**: Insights with stronger evidence receive higher weight
2. **Causal Chain Analysis**: Establishing cause-effect relationships
3. **Temporal Correlation**: Aligning events across time
4. **Pattern Matching**: Comparing to known failure patterns

### Recommendation Generation
Recommendations are generated based on:
1. **Root Cause Severity**: Impact and urgency of the issue
2. **Historical Solutions**: Previously successful resolutions
3. **Implementation Complexity**: Effort required to implement
4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential side effects of recommendations

## Implementation Details

### AWS Bedrock Integration
1. **Agent Prompt Templates**: Specialized prompts for each agent role
2. **Knowledge Base Configuration**: Structure for storing and retrieving incident data
3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration Setup**: AWS Bedrock configuration for agent interaction

### Monitoring and Feedback
1. **Performance Metrics**: Tracking agent response times and accuracy
2. **User Feedback Loop**: Incorporating user feedback on analysis quality
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Refining agent capabilities based on performance

### Extensibility
1. **New Agent Integration**: Protocol for adding specialized agents
2. **Custom Data Source Support**: Framework for integrating additional data sources
3. **Model Upgradeability**: Process for upgrading foundation models
