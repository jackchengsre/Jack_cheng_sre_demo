# AWS Bedrock Capabilities Research

## Foundation Models

AWS Bedrock provides access to a variety of foundation models from multiple providers with different capabilities:

### Key Models with Multi-Modal Capabilities:
- **Amazon Nova Series**:
  - Nova Pro: Supports text, image, and video inputs with text output
  - Nova Lite: Supports text, image, and video inputs with text output
  - Nova Canvas: Supports text and image inputs with image output
  - Nova Reel: Supports text and image inputs with video output

### Other Notable Models:
- **Anthropic Claude 3 Series**: Supports text and image inputs with text/chat outputs
- **Amazon Titan Models**: Various specialized models for text, image, and embedding generation
- **AI21 Labs Jamba Series**: Text and chat capabilities

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

AWS Bedrock supports multi-agent collaboration for complex problem-solving:

- **Hierarchical Collaboration Model**: Supervisor agent coordinates with multiple collaborator agents
- **Role-Based Architecture**: Each agent can be specialized for specific tasks
- **Parallel Processing**: Agents can work simultaneously on different aspects of a problem
- **Orchestration**: Centralized planning and coordination mechanism
- **Tool Integration**: Each agent can access tools, action groups, knowledge bases, and guardrails

## Knowledge Bases Integration

AWS Bedrock Knowledge Bases allow integration of proprietary information:

- **Data Ingestion**: Support for ingesting various data sources
- **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Detailed logging of knowledge base operations
- **Log Types**: APPLICATION_LOGS for tracking data ingestion status
- **Delivery Options**: Logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs, S3, or Firehose
- **Permissions Management**: IAM policies for controlling access

## Monitoring and Observability

AWS Bedrock integrates with monitoring tools for observability:

- **CloudWatch Integration**: Metrics and logs for model invocations
- **Custom Dashboards**: Support for creating specialized monitoring dashboards
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Compatible with Grafana, Dynatrace, and other observability platforms
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Tools for identifying issues in model performance and application behavior

## Relevance for SRE Copilot

For building an SRE copilot with root cause analysis capabilities:

1. **Multi-Modal Foundation Models**: Can process logs (text), metrics (data/charts), and dashboard screenshots (images)
2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Can create specialized agents for different aspects of root cause analysis
3. **Knowledge Bases**: Can store historical incident data, common failure patterns, and resolution steps
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Can connect to existing monitoring systems to access logs and metrics
5. **Observability**: Can leverage CloudWatch and third-party tools for comprehensive visibility

This research confirms that AWS Bedrock provides the necessary capabilities to build an effective SRE copilot for root cause analysis using logs, metrics, and dashboards with multi-agent and multi-modal capabilities.
