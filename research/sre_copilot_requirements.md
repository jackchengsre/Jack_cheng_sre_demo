# SRE Root Cause Analysis Requirements Research

## Log Analysis Patterns

### Key Approaches for Log Analysis:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring patterns in logs that indicate specific issues
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically detecting unusual log patterns that deviate from normal behavior
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using statistical methods like the two-sample KS test to identify significant changes
- **Machine Learning**: Applying ML algorithms to learn normal log patterns and detect deviations
- **Correlation Analysis**: Finding relationships between different log events across services

### Log Anomaly Detection Techniques:
1. **Real-time Analysis**: Processing logs as they are generated to detect issues immediately
2. **Historical Baseline Comparison**: Comparing current log patterns against historical baselines
3. **Pattern Clustering**: Grouping similar log messages to identify common issues
4. **Frequency Analysis**: Detecting unusual increases in specific log types (errors, warnings)
5. **Contextual Analysis**: Understanding log messages in the context of the application architecture

## Metrics Integration Approaches

### Key Metrics for SRE:
- **Four Golden Signals**: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation
- **SLIs/SLOs**: Service Level Indicators and Objectives for measuring reliability
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- **Application-specific Metrics**: Custom metrics relevant to specific services
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement, conversion rates, revenue impact

### Metrics Correlation Techniques:
1. **Cross-metric Correlation**: Finding relationships between different metrics
2. **Metric-to-Log Correlation**: Connecting metric anomalies to relevant log events
3. **Time-series Analysis**: Analyzing patterns and trends in metrics over time
4. **Causal Analysis**: Determining cause-effect relationships between metrics
5. **Topology-aware Correlation**: Understanding relationships based on system architecture

## Dashboard Visualization Options

### Effective Dashboard Elements:
- **Time-series Visualizations**: Showing metric trends over time
- **Heatmaps**: Visualizing density and distribution of events
- **Service Maps**: Displaying relationships between services
- **Alert Timelines**: Showing when alerts were triggered
- **Correlation Panels**: Highlighting relationships between different data sources

### Dashboard Best Practices:
1. **Hierarchical Views**: From high-level overview to detailed drill-downs
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintaining context when navigating between views
3. **Anomaly Highlighting**: Visually emphasizing anomalous patterns
4. **Integrated Views**: Combining logs, metrics, and traces in a single view
5. **Customizable Layouts**: Allowing users to focus on relevant information

## Root Cause Analysis Methodologies

### Effective RCA Approaches:
- **Blameless Postmortems**: Focusing on systemic issues rather than individual mistakes
- **5 Whys Analysis**: Repeatedly asking why to find the underlying cause
- **Fault Tree Analysis**: Breaking down potential causes into a hierarchical structure
- **Change Analysis**: Examining recent changes that might have contributed to the issue
- **Impact Analysis**: Understanding the scope and severity of the incident

### RCA Process Steps:
1. **Incident Detection**: Identifying that an issue exists
2. **Initial Assessment**: Gathering basic information about the incident
3. **Investigation**: Collecting and analyzing relevant data
4. **Root Cause Identification**: Determining the underlying cause
5. **Resolution Planning**: Developing short and long-term fixes
6. **Implementation**: Applying the fixes
7. **Verification**: Confirming the issue is resolved
8. **Documentation**: Recording findings for future reference

## Multi-Agent Architecture Requirements

### Agent Specialization:
- **Log Analysis Agent**: Specialized in processing and analyzing log data
- **Metrics Analysis Agent**: Focused on metric patterns and anomalies
- **Correlation Agent**: Connecting insights from logs, metrics, and traces
- **Visualization Agent**: Presenting findings in an understandable format
- **Recommendation Agent**: Suggesting potential solutions

### Agent Collaboration Patterns:
1. **Hierarchical Collaboration**: Supervisor agent coordinating specialized agents
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents working simultaneously on different aspects
3. **Sequential Processing**: Agents building on each other's findings
4. **Feedback Loops**: Agents refining their analysis based on feedback
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Agents sharing insights through a common knowledge base

## Multi-Modal Capabilities Requirements

### Data Types to Process:
- **Text Logs**: Processing structured and unstructured log data
- **Metrics Data**: Analyzing numerical time-series data
- **Dashboard Screenshots**: Interpreting visual information from dashboards
- **System Topology Maps**: Understanding system architecture and relationships
- **Alert Data**: Processing alert information and context

### Multi-Modal Integration Approaches:
1. **Cross-Modal Correlation**: Finding relationships between different data types
2. **Modal-Specific Processing**: Using specialized techniques for each data type
3. **Unified Representation**: Converting different data types to a common format
4. **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understanding data in the context of the system
5. **Interactive Exploration**: Allowing users to explore data across modalities
